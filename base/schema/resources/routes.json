Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example: Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.\n\nThe API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.",

For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname.
